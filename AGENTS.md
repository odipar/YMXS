# House style

Rules for prose: documents, code comments, commit messages. Each appears once.

## Plain words

Standard terms, not coinages. A compound that says one thing twice is a term
the reader has to decode, and the plain description is shorter than the
compound it replaces.

A noun pressed into service as a verb is the same fault. A repository does
not *vendor* a library: it carries a copy of one, and the copy is what the
sentence is about. Write what happened - copied here, carried here, kept
here - and the reader needs no glossary.

## One vocabulary

Where a project defines its terms, those are the names. A term that changes in
the glossary changes in the code the same day, or there are two vocabularies
to keep in step.

## Programs do not intend

No file, program or algorithm wants, knows, decides, expects or refuses. The
plain verb is there: a source *needs*, a header *declares*, a stage
*resolves*, a reader *does not validate*.

Roles and abstractions follow the rule. A writer does not *promise*, a
document section does not *keep* bits, a verb does not *consume* its
operand, bits do not *stand as they were*. The writer emits, the section
lists, the verb reads, the bits keep their value.

Established technical vocabulary is not this. A resource has an *owner*, a
caller *claims* it, a register *survives* a call.

## Say it once

Four habits that say an idea twice:

- **three of a kind.** `no stale value, no zero, no bus cycle` - say what
  happens and stop.
- **the cleft.** `X is what makes Y` is `X makes Y`.
- **the restatement.** `- which is a compile-time edit` is `- a compile-time
  edit`. Drop `which is` where a comma already carries the appositive; keep it
  before a predicate (`which is true whether…`) or an explanation (`which is
  why…`).
- **filler.** `simply`, `actually`, `precisely`, `entirely`, `at all` - cut
  unless the word carries the meaning: `exactly` for an equality, `entirely in
  memory` for the absence of a file on disk.

Keep a list only where each item carries something the others do not.

## No flourish

Technical prose says what happens and ends. Three habits that decorate
instead:

- **the sweep.** `whatever value is written`, `wherever it sits` - a
  trailing clause that generalises what the sentence already said. Name the
  condition or end the sentence.
- **the metaphor.** `leaves a tail no reader ever touches`, `the pressure
  point` - an image in place of the operation. Write the operation.
- **the verdict.** `this is deliberate`, `asked properly`, `worth reading` -
  the sentence grading itself or its subject. Delete it.

## The verb that says the action

Something *uses* a resource, a bit *marks* a case, a code *selects* an option,
a field *is* the value it stands for. Reserve *names* for what a thing is
called.

Five stand-ins for the action are struck, and a test reads every document for
them:

- **holds.** `what a tune holds` is `the tune data structure`. A table *has*
  columns, a register *keeps* a value, a file *has* tunes in it.
- **states.** `the rate the tune states` is `the tune's rate`. A row *sets* a
  register, a document *defines* a rule.
- **gives.** `what the two chips give` is `the two chips' own figures`. A chip
  does not give: a clock *counts*, a timer *counts* a period, and a column
  *is* one value a row.
- **takes.** `a value the register takes` is `a value that fits the register`,
  and `a reader takes any JSON of this shape` is `a reader reads any JSON of
  this shape`. A tick *reads* a row, a tool's flags *are* what they are, and
  the row that stops an effect *sets* its register back.
- **nothing.** `it states nothing about X` and `and no form is the format` are
  a negation standing where the sentence that says what is there belongs.

## One negative at a time

`a timer no row uses opens none` is a negation twice over, and the reader
has to undo both to learn what happens. Say what is there: `a timer any row
uses opens a table of its own`. Where a rule is about what is left alone, one
negative carries it: `a register the row does not set is absent`.

## Plain names for sections

A heading says what the section is about in the words the reader would use.
`What is turned away` is `What is an error`. Where the project has a name for
the thing, that name goes in the heading: `JSON`, not `The text form`.

## Struck in review

Every remark on a sentence lands here on the day it is made, and in the ban
list of `HouseStyleTest` where a phrase can be matched. The log is what has
been struck so far.

| struck | now |
|---|---|
| `what a tune holds` | `the tune data structure` |
| `the rate the tune states` | `the tune's rate` |
| `what the two chips give` | `the two chips' own figures` |
| `a value the register takes` | `a value that fits the register` |
| `a reader takes any JSON of this shape` | `a reader reads any JSON of this shape` |
| `it states nothing about how a tune is written down` | dropped; the paragraph says what is there |
| `A form is that structure written down, and no form is the format.` | `A form is that structure written down.` |
| `What is turned away` | `What is an error` |
| `the text form`, `the table form` | `JSON`, `CSV` |
| `a timer no row uses opens none` | `a timer any row uses opens a table of its own` |
| `Writing a tune down is a separate job, and a form does it.` | dropped; the form paragraph already says it |
| `Each player names the version of this it reads.` | `Each one says which version of this format it reads.` |

## A specification defines operations

Describe what happens, in terms an implementer can check: what is written, in
what order, and what is left alone. Name no product, routine or source file -
an implementation follows the specification, not the other way round. A rule
that needs a cross-reference to be understood is not yet defined
operationally.

## True beats accurate

A sentence that is literally correct but implies something false is wrong. A
figure without the comparison that makes it meaningful misleads as much as a
wrong figure.

## Measure, do not recall

Check a claim against the thing it describes before writing it. Where a number
has to appear in prose, have a test read it back out and fail when the
sentence carrying it is reworded away.

## One idea per row

Two things in one table cell get a row each, and a heading that covers two
subjects gets split. A column means one thing from top to bottom; where a row
needs a different convention, the cell says so.

## Shape

Wrap at one width and keep it. Rewrap the paragraph you changed and no other:
a blanket reflow buries the words that moved.

No em dash construct anywhere: a dash that must stay is a single `-`.

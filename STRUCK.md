# Struck

What the style check strikes, under the AGENTS.md rule that strikes it.
The check, `org.ymxs.style.HouseStyle`, reads this file and then every
document and code comment in the tree against it. `mvn test` runs it, and
so does

    java -cp target/classes org.ymxs.style.HouseStyle

A section is one rule, and its heading is the rule's heading in AGENTS.md.
An entry is a name on a line of its own, then an indented block: the
pattern, a regular expression over lowered prose, on as many lines as it
takes; then `in:` lines, each a sample the pattern is in, and `not:` lines,
each a sample near it that the pattern is not in. HouseStyleTest reads
every sample back, so a pattern that drifts fails there rather than in
review. Add an entry to strike a construct, and take one off in the same
change that uses the construct.

Before the first rule, three entries are read differently. `names` lists
names a construct is spelled inside which are not that construct, each
blanked before a line is lowered. `carried` lists what the tree carries
from another repository, by a fragment of the path, and `own` what is read
despite being there, by the end of the path. A carried copy follows its
own tree's style.

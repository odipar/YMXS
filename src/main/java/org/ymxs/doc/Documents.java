/**
 * What a check reads of the documents of a tree, apart from their figures.
 *
 * <p>Each repository checks its figures itself: a clause against the code
 * that implements it, a table against what a tool measures. The four
 * here read what every repository of this family requires of a document - a
 * link that resolves, one wrap width, a glossary in order - and each was
 * written four times before it stood here.
 *
 * <p>Each returns the lines to report, empty where the documents are true,
 * so a caller names the rule in the words it uses and says how many
 * documents it expected to read. The documents to read are
 * {@link org.ymxs.style.HouseStyle#documents}, which finds them rather than
 * listing them.
 *
 * <p>This package is carried between the repositories of the family, as
 * {@code org.ymxs.style} is: a copy follows this one line for line.

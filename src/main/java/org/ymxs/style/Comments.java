 * in one is not read. Java, Go and C# write {@code //} and {@code /* *}{@code /};
 * an assembler source writes {@code ;}; Python and a shell script write
 * {@code #}, and Python's triple-quoted docstrings are read as comments too.
 * A Java text block runs from one {@code """} to the next and is a string,

 * One construct the house style strikes, under the AGENTS.md rule that
 * strikes it.
 *
 * <p>A construct is a pattern over lowered prose rather than a word: a verb
 * in every form, a phrase, or a shape such as a verb negating its
 * object. Each lists samples it is in and, where a near miss is worth
 * pinning, samples it is not in; HouseStyleTest reads both back, so a
 * pattern that drifts fails there rather than in review.
